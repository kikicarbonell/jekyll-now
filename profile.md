| Description:          |

The configuration management tools (CMT) essentially allow automation of installation, configuration 
and update of system’s software. The variety of these tools available in the market makes it difficult 
the right selection according to the needs of clients when you do not have consultant experts. The purpose 
of this work is select the features to build a comparative framework and apply it to four of the most 
popular CMT. In order to select some CMT we take into account some benchmarks of previous studies and 
join with others proposed here to obtain a simple comparative framework. The tools selected by popularity 
went: CFEngine, Puppet, Ansible and Salt. This work provides a summary table where the selected features 
are evaluated in each of analyzed tools.
